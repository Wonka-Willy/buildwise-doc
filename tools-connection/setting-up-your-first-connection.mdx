## Understanding Connections vs Tools

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connections" icon="usb">
**Connections** are what you add to AI models - they link WonkaChat to your business systems like Outlook, Slack, or Google Drive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tools" icon="wrench">
**Tools** are the individual capabilities within each connection. For example, an Outlook connection might include tools for reading emails, sending messages, and managing calendar events.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Before You Start

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Check Your Access" icon="user-check">

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate Your Account">
A credential window will appear, requesting authentication for the selected business system. The process varies slightly by connection type:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="OAuth">
<Info>
Use **OAuth** authentication for tools like <strong>Outlook, Gmail, Google Drive</strong>, and most major cloud platforms.
</Info>

1. Click **"Initialize"**.
2. You'll be redirected to the tool's official login page.
3. Enter your credentials on the tool's secure site.
4. You'll be automatically redirected back to WonkaChat.

<Frame caption="OAuth authentication flow">
  <img src="/images/oauth-authentication.png" alt="OAuth authentication window" />
</Frame>
</Tab>

<Tab title="API Key">
<Info>
Choose this method for tools such as <strong>Notion, Linear</strong>, and other provider integrations that require an API key.
</Info>

</Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>


</Step>

<Step title="Enable The Connection">
After successful authentication, you need to activate the MCP connection for the AI model you're using.

1. Click the **"MCP Servers"** button under the chat input field
2. Find your business system in the list
3. Click on it to enable the connection for the current chat

<Check>
Once enabled, the AI model can access this business system whenever you ask it to. You can enable or disable connections at any time.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Connection">
Verify the connection is working by asking the AI a simple question that requires the business system.

### Example For Email (Outlook/Gmail):
```
What emails did I receive today?
```

If the AI successfully retrieves and displays information, your connection is working correctly!

<Check>
Connection successful! You can now use natural language to access and interact with this business system through WonkaChat.
</Check>
</Step>


<Step title="Disable A Connection">

To remove a connection:
1. Click the **"MCP Servers"** button under the chat input field
2. Find your business system in the list
3. Click on it to disable the connection for the current chat by removing it from the selected connections

<Warning>
Disconnecting a business system immediately revokes WonkaChat's access to that service. However, your authentication credentials remain stored securely for future reconnections.
</Warning>

## Understanding Permissions and Actions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What Can WonkaChat Access?" icon="eye">
WonkaChat can only access:
- Data you personally have permission to view in the connected business system
- Information you explicitly ask it to retrieve
- Resources within your organizational boundaries (if applicable)

**WonkaChat cannot:**
- Access data from other users unless they've shared it with you
- Bypass your business system's permission system
- Read or modify data without your explicit request
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Actions Can WonkaChat Perform?" icon="hand">
WonkaChat's capabilities depend entirely on what the MCP server implements for each business system. If a provider exposes an action through their MCP server, the AI can perform it. If an action isn't implemented in the MCP server, the AI cannot access it, regardless of whether the underlying business system supports it.

**Common capabilities include:**
- **Read**: View emails, documents, tasks, calendar events, database records, etc.
- **Write**: Send emails, create tasks, update records, schedule meetings, add comments
- **Delete**: Remove items, archive records, clear data (only when you explicitly ask)
- **Search**: Query across documents, find specific records, filter data
- **Execute**: Run workflows, trigger automations, perform calculations

<Check>
Each MCP server defines its own set of available actions. Check the specific business system's documentation to see what operations are supported through its MCP implementation.
</Check>

**Important:** The AI model is restricted to only the actions that the MCP server exposes. Even if a business system's native interface supports a feature, WonkaChat can only use it if the corresponding MCP server has implemented that capability.

All actions require your explicit instruction through conversation. WonkaChat only performs actions when you ask it to.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How Are Credentials Stored?" icon="lock">
Your authentication tokens are:
- Encrypted at rest in our secure database
- Unique to your user account (never shared with others)
- Automatically refreshed to maintain connection
- Deleted immediately when you disconnect a business system

WonkaChat never stores your actual passwords. It only stores the secure access tokens provided by the OAuth flow or API key you input.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Platform Workflows

Once you've connected several business systems, you can combine them in powerful ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Cross-Platform Queries" icon="arrows-left-right">
Ask questions that span multiple business systems in one request.

**Example:** *"Check my Google Calendar for availability and send those times to Sarah via Outlook."*
</Card>

<Card title="Data Transfer" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
Move information between business systems without manual copy-paste.

**Example:** *"Take the action items from this Slack thread and create tasks in ClickUp."*
</Card>

<Card title="Automated Workflows" icon="gears">
Build agents that monitor one business system and take actions in another.

**Example:** Agent that checks Salesforce for new leads and creates follow-up tasks in Asana.
</Card>

<Card title="Unified Reporting" icon="chart-line">
Combine data from multiple sources for comprehensive insights.

**Example:** *"Summarize my week: emails from Outlook, meetings from Calendar, and completed tasks from Notion."*
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Start with Essential Connections" icon="star">
Connect your most-used business systems first:
1. Email (Outlook or Gmail)
2. Calendar (Google Calendar or Cal.com)
3. Primary project management tool
4. Main document storage

You can always add more connections later as you discover needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Before Complex Workflows" icon="vial">
After connecting a business system:
- Ask simple queries first to verify it works
- Gradually increase complexity
- Understand what data the business system exposes before building workflows
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Review Permissions Periodically" icon="calendar-check">
Every few months:
- Review which business systems are connected
- Disconnect business systems you no longer use
- Verify connections are still active and working
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create AI Agents with Focused Tool Sets" icon="robot">
**Why This Matters:**

AI agents with purpose-built business system connections deliver significantly better results than general-purpose setups. When an agent has access only to relevant business systems for its specific task, it:
- **Reduces hallucinations** by limiting context to what's actually needed
- **Improves accuracy** by focusing on domain-specific data sources
- **Delivers faster responses** with fewer irrelevant tool checks
- **Maintains better context** within its area of expertise

**Best Practice Examples:**

<Accordion title="Sales Agent" icon="handshake">
**Connect only:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Gmail, Calendar

- Focused on customer data and communication
- Won't accidentally query unrelated developer tools
- Understands sales pipeline context deeply
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Development Agent" icon="code">
**Connect only:** GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Slack

- Specialized in code and project management
- Faster because it's not checking email or CRM systems
- Better at understanding technical context
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Executive Assistant Agent" icon="briefcase">
**Connect only:** Outlook, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Notion

- Dedicated to scheduling and document management
- Won't accidentally access technical or sales systems
- More reliable for personal productivity tasks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Operations Agent" icon="gears">
**Connect only:** Odoo, QuickBooks, Airtable, Slack

- Focused on business operations and finance
- Specialized knowledge of operational workflows
- Better at cross-referencing operational data
</Accordion>

<Tip>
Start by creating 2-3 specialized agents for your most common workflows. You'll quickly see the quality difference compared to one agent with all tools connected.
</Tip>
