---

WonkaChat is an enterprise AI chat platform built on top of [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), a robust open-source project with a thriving community. We've enhanced it with enterprise-grade security, governance controls, and compliance features designed for organizations that need to use AI securely with their data.

<Info>
This page covers the built-in security measures and governance controls that WonkaChat provides out of the box.
</Info>

## Governance

Control what AI models, tools, and agents are available in your organization. WonkaChat comes with extensive capabilities out of the box, but you can customize your deployment to include only what's relevant for your company. This helps reducing complexity, minimizing unnecessary access, and maintaining a focused, secure environment.

### Organization Access

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="MCP Selection" icon="plug">
Wonka configures which MCP servers are available to your organization, ensuring only approved tools are accessible.
</Card>

<Card title="AI Model Selection" icon="brain">
Administrators control which AI models and providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) users can access within the organization.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
These governance controls ensure your organization uses only approved AI resources that align with your security policies and compliance requirements.
</Tip>

Beyond WonkaChat's built-in security measures, your organization maintains direct control over user access. For example, admins manage which agents are available to users and grant granular permissions per agent. See [Access Control](/security-governance/access-control) for details.

## Security Architecture

WonkaChat implements enterprise-grade security with multiple layers of protection.

### Authentication System

WonkaChat uses a secure, token-based authentication system to protect user access:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Access Tokens (15 minutes)" icon="key">
Short-lived access tokens allow users to authenticate and interact with the platform. These tokens expire after 15 minutes, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access if compromised.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Refresh Tokens (7 days)" icon="rotate">
Refresh tokens maintain user sessions for up to 7 days without requiring re-authentication. After 7 days, users need to log in again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JWT Technology" icon="shield-check">
WonkaChat uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication. JWTs are cryptographically signed to prevent tampering and verify authenticity.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
This dual-token approach balances security (short-lived access) with user convenience (session persistence).
</Check>

### Authentication Providers

Multiple authentication methods are available to integrate with your existing identity systems:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Available Now">
WonkaChat currently supports these authentication providers:

- **Local Authentication**: Username and password authentication
- **OpenID Connect**: Integration with OpenID-compliant identity providers
- **Azure AD / Entra ID**: Direct integration with Microsoft Azure Active Directory

<Tip>
Choose the authentication method that aligns with your organization's identity management strategy.
</Tip>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Coming Soon">
Additional social login providers are planned for future releases:

- Google authentication
- GitHub authentication
- Other popular social providers

<Info>
These providers are not currently available but are on the roadmap.
</Info>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

WonkaChat implements rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks and system abuse. Rate limits are applied across critical operations including login attempts, registration, password resets, administrative actions, and general API usage.

<Check>
Rate limits protect your organization from automated attacks while allowing normal user activity.
</Check>

Complete data isolation between organizations through subdomain-based routing (https://{org}.wonka.chat). No accidental data exposure across tenants.
</Card>

<Card title="No Model Training" icon="ban">
Your conversations and data are never used to train AI models. Model providers process requests temporarily without retention. Your data stays in WonkaChat where you control it.
</Card>

<Card title="Encrypted in Transit" icon="lock">
All data transmitted to and from WonkaChat is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols for secure API communications.
</Card>

<Card title="Encrypted at Rest" icon="shield-halved">

- API keys and authentication tokens are never logged in plain text
- Token rotation prevents long-term exposure
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before any storage

<Check>
Even system administrators cannot access your passwords or sensitive credentials in logs or databases.
</Check>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

WonkaChat ensures complete separation between organizations:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Organization-Scoped Data">
Every piece of data in WonkaChat is scoped to your organization:
- Conversations and chat history
- AI agents and configurations
- User accounts and permissions
- MCP connections and tool settings
- Audit logs and activity records

<Check>
Data from one organization is completely isolated and inaccessible to other organizations.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Subdomain Routing">
Each organization has its own unique subdomain:
- **Format**: `https://{your-org}.wonka.chat`
- **Benefit**: Built-in namespace isolation at the network level
- **Security**: Prevents cross-organization data leakage

<Info>
Subdomain-based routing adds an extra layer of separation beyond database-level isolation.

When you interact with an AI model, your prompts and responses are sent to the model provider, processed in memory, and immediately discarded by the provider after generating the response. 

**Your conversations are securely stored in WonkaChat** for you to access your history, but model providers (Azure, AWS) never retain, store, or use your data for training or any other purpose.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
Your conversation history is securely stored in WonkaChat where you control it. Model providers only process requests temporarily without any data retention or reuse.
</Check>
