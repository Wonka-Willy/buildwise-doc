## Think of Agents as Specialized Colleagues

Imagine you have a team of specialists in your office, each one an expert in a specific part of your construction business:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Your General Advisor" icon="user-tie">
Understands construction broadly, knows Belgian regulations, and guides you to the right specialist when needed
</Card>

<Card title="Your Quote Reviewer" icon="magnifying-glass">
Looks at your drafted quotes with a trained, consistent method to spot weak points and missing elements
</Card>

<Card title="Your Document Inspector" icon="clipboard-check">
Checks tender documents and BoQs for inconsistencies, unclear quantities, and structural mistakes
</Card>

<Card title="Your Meeting Secretary" icon="edit">
Turns raw notes into structured, professional minutes with decisions and clear responsibilities
</Card>
</CardGroup>

These aren’t generic chatbots — they’re **purpose-trained assistants** that behave predictably and professionally.

## Regular Chat vs. AI Agents

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Regular AI Chat">
**Starts from scratch every time**
- Has no fixed role or persistent expertise  
- Needs you to re-explain context  
- Gives general responses not tailored to construction  
- Works like a helpful intern who needs guidance  

**Example:**  
*"Check this quote for problems?"*  
→ Response depends on the moment, not on construction rules or Belgian standards
</Tab>

<Tab title="AI Agents">
**Stable role and behavior**
- Always operates from its permanent specialization  
- Understands construction workflows by default  
- Applies structured methods (analysis formats, checklists, etc.)  
- Works like a team member who always knows their job  

**Example:**  
Upload a quote → The quote specialist immediately applies its usual process without you explaining what to analyze.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Makes Agents Special?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Built-in Expertise" icon="brain">
Agents keep their professional focus at all times:
- Construction principles  
- Belgian regulatory context  
- Terminology and workflows  
</Card>

<Card title="Consistent Behavior" icon="check">
Every agent answers in a fixed, predictable structure:
- Clear sections  
- Professional language  
- Repeatable methodology  
- Same quality today and tomorrow  
</Card>

<Card title="Specialized Roles" icon="users">
Instead of one AI doing everything, you have **multiple focused assistants**:
- One for general advice  
- One for quote analysis  
- One for tender checks  
- One for meeting minutes  
</Card>

## Why Agents Work Better for Construction

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Industry Awareness" icon="hard-hat">
Agents are trained with construction logic in mind:
- Belgian codes and standards  
- Typical documents (BoQs, quotes, specs, notes)  
- Common risks and best practices  
</Card>

<Card title="Professional Output" icon="check-circle">
You always receive:
- Clear structure  
- Actionable findings  
- Neutral, consistent tone  
- Outputs fit for professional use  
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### **Example: Quote Analysis**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="With Regular AI">
**You:** *"Check this quote for issues"*  
**AI:** *"Could you explain what you want me to look for?"*  

→ You need to give instructions, context, and construction details again.
</Tab>

<Tab title="With an AI Agent">
**You:** *Upload quote document*  

**Agent:** Immediately uses its predefined method:
- Summary  
- Financial/technical/contractual checks  
- Weak spots  
- Opportunities  

→ You get consistent, construction-aware results instantly.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
