## Think of Agents as Specialized Assistants

Imagine you have six different assistants in your office, each one an expert in a specific part of your construction business:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Your Paperwork Assistant" icon="file-text">
Always knows how to write quotes, reports, and formal documents in the right format
</Card>

<Card title="Your Quality Control Assistant" icon="magnifying-glass">
Specializes in catching errors, missing items, and potential problems in your documents
</Card>

<Card title="Your Project Assistant" icon="hammer">
Expert at handling variations, extra work, and project changes
</Card>

<Card title="Your Admin Assistant" icon="calculator">
Focused on organizing meetings, notes, and administrative tasks
</Card>
</CardGroup>

**That's exactly what AI agents are** - except they're digital, available 24/7, and never forget their training.

## Regular Chat vs. AI Agents

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Regular AI Chat">
**Starts fresh every time**
- No memory of its role or specialization
- You have to explain what you need each time
- Generic answers that might miss construction details
- Like hiring a new temp worker for every task

**Example:**
*"Can you help me write a quote for bathroom renovation?"*
→ Gets generic response, might miss Belgian regulations or construction-specific requirements
</Tab>

<Tab title="AI Agents">
**Persistent expertise and role**
- Remembers it's a construction specialist
- Already knows your industry terminology
- Follows consistent methods every time
- Like having a trusted colleague who knows their job

**Example:**
*"Bathroom renovation, 2x3m, tiles and plumbing"*
→ **Quote Builder Agent** automatically creates complete scope, assumptions, exclusions, and planning
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Makes Agents Special?

## Real-World Analogy

<Steps>
<Step title="Your Office Team">
In a construction company, you might have:
- **Project Manager** - handles planning and coordination
- **Estimator** - creates quotes and cost analysis  
- **Quality Inspector** - checks work and finds problems
- **Admin Assistant** - handles paperwork and reports
</Step>

<Step title="Tooli's Agent Team">
Similarly, Tooli gives you digital specialists:
- **Quote Builder** - creates professional quotes
- **Quality Coach** - analyzes and improves your work
- **BoQ Checker** - finds errors and gaps
- **Report Builder** - transforms notes into clear reports
</Step>

<Step title="Always Available">
Unlike human assistants, AI agents:
- Work 24/7, even during weekend emergencies
- Never get sick or take vacation
- Handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- Remember every detail from previous conversations
</Step>
</Steps>
