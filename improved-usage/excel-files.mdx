## A More Natural Way to Use Excel

Tooli understands Excel the way you describe it — through labels, context and meaning. No cell references. No technical instructions.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Examples You Can Try">

**Creating files:**
- "Create a sheet Quantities with columns Item, Unit, Qty."  
- "Make an Excel with all materials from this PDF."  
- "Build a planning table with dates and tasks."

**Viewing data:**
- "Show me the first ten rows."  
- "Display only the Item and Quantity columns."  
- "What's inside the sheet Summary?"

**Editing files:**
- "Move this table into a new sheet called Summary."  
- "Rename Sheet2 to Materials."  
- "Add a total at the bottom of the Qty column."

</Tab>

<Tab title="How Tooli Places Data">
Tooli uses the **existing column names and structure** in your file to find where values belong. It understands labels like "Name / Nom / Naam", "Quantity / Quantité / Hoeveelheid", etc.

You focus on the content — Tooli handles the placement.

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Use clear, descriptive column headers. Tooli works best when column names clearly describe their content (e.g., "Item", "Quantity", "Unit Price" rather than "A", "B", "C").
</Tip>

## Work Directly Inside the Chat

- "Display rows 1 to 20."  
- "Show only the Item and Quantity columns."  
- "What's inside the sheet Summary?"

Tooli renders clean tables so you can review before continuing.

## Tips for Better Results

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Use Clear Column Names" icon="file-text">
Simple, descriptive headers help Tooli understand and place values correctly.

**Good:** "Item", "Quantity", "Unit Price"  
**Avoid:** "A", "B", "C" or vague names
</Card>

<Card title="Work in Short Steps" icon="check">
Small, focused instructions produce cleaner results than complex, multi-part requests.

Break down large tasks into smaller steps.
</Card>

<Card title="Preview Before Downloading" icon="eye">
Ask to display a portion of the sheet to verify the output matches your expectations.

**Example:** "Show me rows 1-10" or "Display the summary sheet."
</Card>

<Card title="Upload the Best Version Available" icon="upload">
Clear PDFs or photos improve extraction quality significantly.
