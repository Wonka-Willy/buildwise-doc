# Cookie Policy
**Last updated: November 1, 2025**

## I. Purpose

This Policy is established by Buildwise, publisher of the website *website URL link* (hereinafter the "website"), whose registered office is located at Kleine Kloosterstraat 23, 1932 Zaventem, registered with the Belgian Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under number 0407.695.057, ("Buildwise", "we", "our"), strives to offer you the best possible service and therefore wishes to preserve the trust you place in our company by informing you of our policy for using and storing cookies.

## II. What is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive or mobile device that is issued by the server of the website you are visiting.

The cookie contains a unique code that allows its issuer to recognize the terminal concerned (your computer or mobile device) each time the website is visited.

The cookie identifies your terminal's browser but never you personally. Furthermore, a website server can only read the cookies it has placed itself and has no access to any other information on your computer or mobile device.

Cookies can either be placed by the server of the website you are visiting ("first-party cookies") or by partners with whom this website collaborates ("third-party cookies").

## III. Cookie Validity Duration

Some cookies expire when you close your browser ("session cookies"), while others remain longer on your terminal, sometimes even until you manually delete them ("persistent cookies").

Generally, cookies have a limited validity period. The most common validity period is 30 days and the maximum duration is 13 months from the day the cookie is placed on your terminal.

## IV. General Purposes of Cookies
