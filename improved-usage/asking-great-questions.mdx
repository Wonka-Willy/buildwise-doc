## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is simply the question or instruction you give to an AI system. Think of it as briefing a colleague - the clearer and more detailed your brief, the better results you'll get.

In construction work, a good prompt is like giving clear project instructions: you wouldn't tell a subcontractor "do some electrical work" - you'd specify exactly what needs to be done, where, when, and to what standards.

<Info>
The quality of AI responses directly correlates with the clarity and structure of your prompts. Small improvements in how you ask questions can dramatically improve results for your construction projects.

## The MASTER Prompt Technique

For complex construction tasks, use the **MASTER framework** to structure comprehensive prompts that get professional results every time:

### Real Example: Kitchen Renovation Quote Request

Let's say you need to create a quote for a kitchen renovation. Here's how to build your prompt using MASTER:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="M - Mission" icon="flag">
**What you want to accomplish**

"Create a professional quote for a complete kitchen renovation that will help me win this client project."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="A - Anchor" icon="anchor">
**Key project details that matter**

"Kitchen is 12m² in a 1980s house in Ghent. Client budget is €20,000-25,000. They want modern style with island. Timeline needed: 6 weeks. Access is narrow - only 80cm door to street."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="S - Samples" icon="lightbulb">
**Examples or references to follow**

"Format should be similar to our previous successful quotes - professional layout with clear sections. I've attached our standard template structure."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="T - Tone" icon="message">
**How formal and for whom**

"Professional but warm tone for homeowner clients (not technical contractors). Should feel trustworthy and explain things clearly."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="E - Elements" icon="list">
**Specific sections to include**

"Include: project summary, detailed scope by trade, timeline with milestones, total cost breakdown, payment schedule, and our 5-year warranty terms."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="R - Role" icon="user-tie">
**Your professional perspective**

"You are an experienced Belgian general contractor with 12 years specializing in residential kitchen renovations."
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### The Complete MASTER Prompt

**M + A + S + T + E + R =**

> "Create a professional quote for a complete kitchen renovation that will help me win this client project.
>
> Kitchen is 12m² in a 1980s house in Ghent. Client budget is €20,000-25,000. They want modern style with island. Timeline needed: 6 weeks. Access is narrow - only 80cm door to street.
>
> Format should be similar to our previous successful quotes - professional layout with clear sections. I've attached our standard template structure.
>
> Professional but warm tone for homeowner clients (not technical contractors). Should feel trustworthy and explain things clearly.
>
> Include: project summary, detailed scope by trade, timeline with milestones, total cost breakdown, payment schedule, and our 5-year warranty terms.
>
> You are an experienced Belgian general contractor with 12 years specializing in residential kitchen renovations."

### Why MASTER Works

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Clear Goal" icon="bullseye">
**Mission** tells the AI exactly what success looks like for you
</Card>

<Card title="Right Context" icon="info">
**Anchor + Samples** give all the project details that shape the response
</Card>

<Card title="Perfect Format" icon="file">
**Tone + Elements + Role** ensure you get something you can actually use
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Start Simple: You don't need all 6 letters every time. For quick questions, just use Mission + Anchor + Tone. For complex work like quotes or reports, use the full MASTER framework.

## Essential Principles & Output Formats

Master these fundamentals and get responses in formats you can immediately use:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
**Instead of:** "Tell me about foundations"
**Try:** "Compare strip, pad, and raft foundations for 2-story house on clay soil in Belgium"
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Context" icon="info">
**Always include:** Project type, location, budget, timeline, and who will use the response
</Card>

<Card title="Request Usable Formats" icon="list">
**Examples:** Lists, comparison tables, step-by-step instructions, client-ready summaries
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Project Management">
**Request:** "List the 5 most critical phases for a bathroom renovation project. For each phase include: duration estimate, key trades involved, dependencies, and potential delays to watch for."

**You get:** Organized, scannable information ready for project planning.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Client Presentations">
**Request:** "Create a comparison table for kitchen countertop materials with columns for: cost per m², durability, maintenance needs, and Belgian supplier availability."

**You get:** Professional comparison ready for client decision-making.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Technical Implementation">
**Request:** "Provide step-by-step instructions for installing underfloor heating in bathroom renovation, including safety considerations and Belgian electrical compliance checkpoints."

**You get:** Detailed procedures for safe, compliant work.

**Agent advantage:** Will ask clarifying questions and guide you to the right specialist
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quote Builder - Your Pricing Specialist" icon="calculator">
**Perfect for:** Creating complete project quotes from client requests

**Include:** Space dimensions, desired finishes, budget range, timeline, site conditions

**Example:** "Bathroom renovation, 2.5x1.8m, modern walk-in shower, €12,000 budget, 1970s apartment in Antwerp"

**Agent advantage:** Will ask for missing details to complete professional quotes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quality Coach - Your Improvement Expert" icon="check-circle">

## Advanced Strategies & Common Mistakes

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Iterative Development">
Build complex solutions step-by-step:

1. **Start Basic:** "I need help planning a loft conversion in a 1930s house in Brussels."
2. **Add Specifics:** "The space is 40m², client wants 2 bedrooms, structural beams present, budget €35,000."
3. **Focus Details:** "Given the structural beams, what are Belgian building code requirements for ceiling height and emergency egress?"

**Why this works:** Each step builds naturally without overwhelming the initial prompt.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Conversation Building">
Use previous responses to explore related challenges:

1. **Initial:** "Explain structural considerations for wall removal in 1960s home"
2. **Follow-up:** "You mentioned load-bearing assessment - what specific tests should we conduct?"
3. **Deep dive:** "If it's load-bearing, what are cost-effective beam solutions for 4-meter span?"

**Result:** Deep, interconnected advice that addresses real project complexity.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Avoid These Mistakes">
**Generic Questions:** "Tell me about bathroom renovations"
→ **Better:** Include specific project details, location, budget, client requirements

**Missing Context:** "Create a quote" without project details
→ **Better:** Always answer: What? Where? When? How much? For whom?

**Audience Confusion:** Unclear if response is for clients or technical use
→ **Better:** Specify audience and required formality level
</Tab>
</Tabs>
