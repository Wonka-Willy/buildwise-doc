## A smarter way to work in construction

Every day, people in construction deal with the same challenges:  
long specs, unclear tender texts, missing details, site questions, urgent decisions.

Some already try to use AI to help. Others prefer not to touch it yet.

Tooli is made for **both** — a safe, construction-ready assistant that fits naturally into your daily work.

## Specialists — not a one-size-fits-all assistant

Instead of one assistant that tries to do everything, Tooli gives you **four construction roles** that each think differently:

- **General Assistant** → general help, materials, standards, explanations  
- **Offer Coach** → reviews your quotes and improves clarity & structure  
- **Tender Checker** → spots risks, gaps, and inconsistencies in BoQs/specs  
- **Meeting Minutes Writer** → turns raw notes into clean reports  

<Note>
You don’t need to configure anything — just switch when your task changes.
</Note>

---

## The difference you feel every day

Tooli isn’t about flashy AI.  
It’s about **saving time** and **avoiding mistakes** in the moments that matter:

- when you’re in a hurry on site  
- when a tender is unclear  
- when a quote needs to be tightened  
- when your notes need to become a report  
- when a client needs an answer now  

And because Tooli is shaped with the sector, it keeps getting better —  
with features built specifically for Belgian construction, not for everybody.

<Note>
**Generic AI:** broad, inconsistent, not built for your job  
**Tooli:** precise, compliant, tailored to Belgian construction  
</Note>
