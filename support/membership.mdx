## Common Registration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email address not recognized">
    <Warning>
    **Message shown:**  
    "We cannot find a profile for this email address at Embuild, Bouwunie, Constructiv, or Buildwise.  
    If you are already a member of one of these organizations, please first create an account on their website.  
    Please note that it may take up to one day for the link to become active.  
    After that, you can create an account here using the same email address."
    </Warning>

    **How to fix it:**

    1. Verify you have an **active subscription** with one of the partner organizations
    2. Make sure you're using the **exact email address** registered with your partner organization
    3. If you just subscribed, wait up to 24 hours for synchronization
    4. Contact your partner organization to confirm your email is correctly registered in their system

    <Tip>
    Use the same email address you provided when subscribing to your partner organization.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email verification link not received or expired">
    <Warning>
    **Message shown:**  
    "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account. Didn't receive it? [Resend verification email]"
    </Warning>

    **How to fix it:**

    1. Check your **spam/junk folder**
    2. Click **"Resend verification email"** on the registration confirmation page
    3. Use your **professional email domain** (not a personal email address)
    4. Wait 60 seconds before requesting another email

    <Tip>
    Prefer your official company email domain rather than a private email address.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account already exists">
    <Warning>
    **Message shown (verified account):**  
    "An account with this email address already exists. [Log in here] or [Reset your password]"
    </Warning>

    <Warning>
    **Message shown (unverified account):**  
    "An account with this email address already exists but is not yet verified. Please check your email for the verification link. [Resend verification email]"
    </Warning>

    **How to fix it:**

    1. If your account is verified, try logging in with your existing credentials
    2. If you forgot your password, click **"Forgot your password?"**
    3. If your account is not verified, check your email for the verification link or request a new one
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account temporarily banned">
    <Warning>
    **Message shown:**  
    "Your account has been temporarily banned due to violations of our service."
    </Warning>

    **How to fix it:**

    1. Wait **15 minutes** before retrying
    2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
    3. Try an **incognito/private browsing window**
    4. If the issue persists, contact support@meetwonka.com

    <Note>
    This ban is triggered after multiple failed login attempts. If you're experiencing this issue without making multiple attempts, please contact support.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Buildwise SSO login issues">
    <Warning>
    **Important:** If you created your account via **Buildwise SSO**, you must continue using Buildwise SSO to log in.
    </Warning>

    **How it works:**

    - **Option 1:** Create a Tooli account with email/password first, then link Buildwise SSO later
    - **Option 2:** Register directly via Buildwise SSO (you must always use SSO to log in)

    <Note>
    You cannot switch from SSO login to email/password login after registration. Email/password account must be created first, then Buildwise SSO can be linked to it - not the other way around.
    </Note>
