title: "Asking Great Questions"
description: "Master the fundamentals of effective prompting and advanced techniques to get the best results from Tooli's construction-specific [AI agents](/ai-agents/introduction)."

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is simply the question or instruction you give to an AI agent. Think of it as briefing a colleague - the clearer and more detailed your brief, the better results you'll get.

In construction work, a good prompt is like giving clear project instructions: you wouldn't tell a subcontractor "do some electrical work" - you'd specify exactly what needs to be done, where, when, and to what standards.

<Info>
The quality of AI responses directly correlates with the clarity and structure of your prompts. Small improvements in how you ask questions can dramatically improve results for your construction projects.

## The MASTER Prompt Technique

For complex construction tasks, use the **MASTER framework** to structure comprehensive prompts that get professional results every time:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="M - Mission" icon="flag">
**What you need to accomplish**

Clearly state your goal and what you want to achieve.

**Examples:**
- "Create a professional quote for client presentation"
- "Analyze this structural plan for safety issues"
- "Write a delay notification email to maintain client trust"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="A - Anchor" icon="anchor">
**Key project details and constraints**

Provide essential project context that shapes the response.

**Include:**
- Project type and location
- Budget and timeline constraints
- Site limitations or special requirements
- Regulatory requirements (Belgian codes, permits)

**Example:**
"Kitchen renovation in 1960s townhouse, Ghent. Budget €25,000-30,000, 8-week timeline, narrow access, family living on-site during work."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="S - Samples" icon="lightbulb">
**Examples of successful similar work**

Reference similar projects or attach examples of the format you want.

**Examples:**
- "I've attached previous client emails that were well-received"
- "Similar to the bathroom project we completed in Antwerp"
- "Format like our standard safety reports"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="T - Tone" icon="message">
**Professional level and audience**

Specify how formal or technical the response should be.

**Options:**
- Professional but warm (client communication)
- Technical and precise (permit applications)
- Simple and clear (homeowner explanations)
- Formal and structured (contract variations)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="E - Elements" icon="list">
**Specific components to include**

List exactly what sections or information you need.

**Example for quote:**
- Executive summary for client
- Detailed scope breakdown by trade
- Timeline with key milestones
- Payment schedule and warranty terms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="R - Role" icon="user-tie">
**Your expertise and perspective**

Tell the AI what professional perspective to take.

**Examples:**
- "You are an experienced general contractor"
- "Respond as a Belgian structural engineer"
- "Take the perspective of a project manager"
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### MASTER Example in Action

<Tabs>
<Tab title="The Prompt">
Write a project delay notification email to the client for our kitchen renovation.

**MISSION:** Inform client about 1-week delay while maintaining trust and professionalism

**ANCHOR:** Our company, Bouwwerken VDB, is renovating their kitchen in a 1960s home in Leuven. Discovered asbestos tiles during demolition that require certified removal. Project was scheduled to complete next Friday, now delayed until the following week.

**SAMPLES:** I've attached previous client communications that were well-received - they focus on solutions rather than problems and include clear next steps.

**TONE:** Professional but reassuring, focusing on safety and solution-oriented approach while acknowledging the inconvenience.

**ELEMENTS:**
- Explanation of delay (asbestos discovery and safety requirements)
- Revised timeline with new completion date
- How we're handling the additional cost (absorbed by us)
- Safety measures being taken
- Daily progress updates during remediation

**ROLE:** You are an experienced general contractor with 15 years in residential renovation.
</Tab>

<Tab title="The Result">
The AI delivers a professional, empathetic email that:
- Explains the safety necessity clearly
- Takes responsibility appropriately
- Provides specific new timeline
- Reassures about cost coverage
- Maintains client confidence
- Includes proactive communication plan
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Essential Principles & Output Formats

Master these fundamentals and get responses in formats you can immediately use:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
**Instead of:** "Tell me about foundations"
**Try:** "Compare strip, pad, and raft foundations for 2-story house on clay soil in Belgium"
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Context" icon="info">
**Always include:** Project type, location, budget, timeline, and who will use the response
</Card>

<Card title="Request Usable Formats" icon="list">
**Examples:** Lists, comparison tables, step-by-step instructions, client-ready summaries
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Project Management">
**Request:** "List the 5 most critical phases for a bathroom renovation project. For each phase include: duration estimate, key trades involved, dependencies, and potential delays to watch for."

**You get:** Organized, scannable information ready for project planning.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Client Presentations">
**Request:** "Create a comparison table for kitchen countertop materials with columns for: cost per m², durability, maintenance needs, and Belgian supplier availability."

**You get:** Professional comparison ready for client decision-making.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Technical Implementation">
**Request:** "Provide step-by-step instructions for installing underfloor heating in bathroom renovation, including safety considerations and Belgian electrical compliance checkpoints."

**You get:** Detailed procedures for safe, compliant work.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Agent advantage:** Will ask clarifying questions and guide you to the right specialist
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quote Builder - Your Pricing Specialist" icon="calculator">
**Perfect for:** Creating complete project quotes from client requests

**Include:** Space dimensions, desired finishes, budget range, timeline, site conditions

**Example:** "Bathroom renovation, 2.5x1.8m, modern walk-in shower, €12,000 budget, 1970s apartment in Antwerp"

**Agent advantage:** Will ask for missing details to complete professional quotes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quality Coach - Your Improvement Expert" icon="check-circle">

## Advanced Strategies & Common Mistakes

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Iterative Development">
Build complex solutions step-by-step:

1. **Start Basic:** "I need help planning a loft conversion in a 1930s house in Brussels."
2. **Add Specifics:** "The space is 40m², client wants 2 bedrooms, structural beams present, budget €35,000."
3. **Focus Details:** "Given the structural beams, what are Belgian building code requirements for ceiling height and emergency egress?"

**Why this works:** Each step builds naturally without overwhelming the initial prompt.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Conversation Building">
Use previous responses to explore related challenges:

1. **Initial:** "Explain structural considerations for wall removal in 1960s home"
2. **Follow-up:** "You mentioned load-bearing assessment - what specific tests should we conduct?"
3. **Deep dive:** "If it's load-bearing, what are cost-effective beam solutions for 4-meter span?"

**Result:** Deep, interconnected advice that addresses real project complexity.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Avoid These Mistakes">
**Generic Questions:** "Tell me about bathroom renovations"
→ **Better:** Include specific project details, location, budget, client requirements

**Missing Context:** "Create a quote" without project details
→ **Better:** Always answer: What? Where? When? How much? For whom?

**Audience Confusion:** Unclear if response is for clients or technical use
→ **Better:** Specify audience and required formality level
</Tab>
</Tabs>
