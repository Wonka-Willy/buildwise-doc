## 2. Relationship between the Parties

### 2.1. Appointment as Processor

The User, in their capacity as Data Controller, appoints Buildwise as Processor to process the Personal Data described in Annex I ("Data"). Each Party undertakes to comply with the obligations incumbent upon it under the applicable Data Protection Law.

## 3. Purposes of processing

### 3.1. Permitted Purpose

Buildwise undertakes, in its capacity as Processor, to process the Data only for the purposes described in Annex I and solely on documented instructions from the User ("Permitted Purpose"), unless otherwise required by the applicable Data Protection Law.

### 3.2. Processing Limitations

In no circumstances shall Buildwise process the Data for its own purposes or for those of third parties. Buildwise shall inform the User without delay if it considers that an instruction given by the latter constitutes a breach of the applicable Data Protection Law.

## 4. Onward transfers

### 4.1. Transfer Restrictions

Buildwise undertakes not to transfer Data (nor to authorise an onward Sub-processor to transfer Data) to a country or region outside the EEA ("Onward Transfers") unless that country or region has been recognised by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Law.

### 4.2. Safeguards for Transfers

If Data is to be transferred to, stored by or accessed by a Sub-processor located in a country or region outside the EEA for which the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision, such an Onward transfer may only take place if Buildwise has implemented appropriate safeguards with the Sub-processor designed to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection for the transferred Data, in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Law. These safeguards may include, in particular, the conclusion of standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission between Buildwise and the Sub-processor concerned.

### 4.3. Sub-processor List

Buildwise shall inform the User by maintaining an up-to-date list of Sub-processors involved in the processing or transfer of Data, including those located outside the EEA. This list shall specify the location of the Sub-processors and the safeguards implemented to govern the transfers of Data.

## 5. Confidentiality of processing

### 5.1. Confidentiality Obligations

Buildwise shall ensure that any person whom it authorises to process the Data (including Buildwise's staff and Sub-processors) ("Authorised Person") is subject to a strict obligation of confidentiality (whether contractual or statutory). Buildwise shall prohibit any person not subject to such an obligation of confidentiality from processing the Data. Buildwise shall ensure that any Authorised person processes the Data only in accordance with the Permitted purpose.

## 6. Security

### 6.1. Security Measures

Buildwise undertakes to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and in particular to protect the Data against (i) the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or (ii) accidental or unlawful unauthorised access to the Data ("Security Incident"). These measures must take into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

### 6.2. Technical Measures

These measures may include, amongst other things and as required:

## 7. Onward Sub-processors

### 7.1. Sub-processor Authorization

The user consents to Buildwise being able to subcontract part or all of the processing of the Data to a third party ("Onward Sub-processor") provided that: (i) Buildwise informs the User at least 30 days in advance of any addition or removal of an onward Sub-processor, by updating its list of sub-processors, specifying the nature of the processing entrusted and the location of the Sub-processor concerned; (ii) Buildwise imposes on any onward Sub-processor it appoints the same obligations in respect of Data protection as those imposed on Buildwise under this Agreement; and (iii) Buildwise remains liable for any failure by the onward Sub-processor to meet its obligations arising from an act, omission or negligence on the part of the latter.

### 7.2. Approved Sub-processors

A list of onward Sub-processors approved as at the date of this Agreement is provided in Annex II. Buildwise undertakes to keep this list up to date and to make it available to the User whenever it adds or removes onward Sub-processor(s) in accordance with this clause.

### 7.3. Objection Process

If the User raises objections, on grounds objectively related to the protection of Personal Data, to the appointment by Buildwise of an onward Sub-processor, the Parties undertake to meet in good faith within a reasonable time frame in order to examine the grounds for such refusal and to seek together an appropriate solution.

### 7.4. Resolution Options

In the absence of agreement within thirty (30) days following notification of the refusal, the User may, at its option a) accept the proposed appointment subject to, where applicable, additional safeguards provided by Buildwise; or b) suspend or terminate this Agreement, without penalty for Buildwise and without prejudice to obligations already performed.

## 8. Assistance and data subject rights

### 8.1. Support Obligations

Buildwise provides the User with reasonable and timely assistance, including through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to enable the User to respond to: (i) any request from a Data Subject concerning the exercise of their rights under the applicable Data Protection Law (including, where applicable, rights of access, rectification, objection, erasure and data portability); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint from a Data Subject, a supervisory authority or any other third party in connection with the processing of the Data. In the event that such a request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is addressed directly to Buildwise, the latter shall inform the User without delay, without responding to it, and by transmitting all relevant information.

### 8.2. Assistance Fees

Any request for assistance that is unreasonable or involves disproportionate effort for Buildwise may be subject to specific charges, at an hourly rate of €120 excluding VAT, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.

## 9. Security incident

### 9.1. Incident Notification

As soon as it becomes aware of a Security incident, Buildwise shall inform the User without delay, and provide them, as quickly as possible, with all the information and assistance requested in order to enable the User to satisfy its legal obligations regarding notification of a data breach in accordance with the requirements and time frames provided for by the applicable Data Protection Law. This information includes at least information on the origin, scope and consequences.

### 9.2. Remediation

Buildwise shall take all necessary measures and actions to remedy the Security incident and/or mitigate its effects, and shall keep the User informed of any developments relating to that Security incident.

## 10. Deletion or return of Data

### 10.1. End of Agreement

At the end of this Agreement or in the event of termination thereof, Buildwise must (at the User's option) either destroy or return to Buildwise all of the Data (including all copies of the Data) in its possession or under its control (including any Data processed by an onward Sub-processor).

### 10.2. Legal Retention

This Clause does not apply where Buildwise is required, under European Union law or the law of an EEA Member State, to retain some or all of the Data, in which case Buildwise must isolate and protect the Data from any further processing, except to the extent that such processing is required by applicable law, and until their final deletion.

## 11. Processing log

### 11.1. Record Keeping

Buildwise undertakes to maintain a record of all processing carried out on behalf of the User in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Law.

## 12. Audit

### 12.1. Audit Rights

Buildwise authorises a third party auditor appointed by the User to verify its compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. For this purpose, Buildwise shall make available to the User all information, systems and personnel necessary to conduct the audit.

### 12.2. Audit Conditions

Buildwise acknowledges that the third party may access its premises for the purposes of carrying out such verification, provided that the User notifies Buildwise of its intention to conduct an audit by giving reasonable notice of at least thirty (30) working days, that the audit is carried out during normal business hours, and all reasonable measures are taken to avoid any disruption to Buildwise's operations. The User can only exercise this audit right once in a twelve (12) calendar months period, except (i) if a competent data protection authority requires or instructs it or (ii) if the User considers that a further verification is justified by reason of a Security incident occurring at Buildwise.

### 12.3. Audit Costs

All audits will be conducted at the User's expense. Any additional assistance requested from Buildwise in relation to the audit may give rise to additional charges, at an hourly rate of €120 excluding VAT, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.

## 13. Applicable law and competent jurisdictions

### 13.1. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Belgian law and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Brussels.
