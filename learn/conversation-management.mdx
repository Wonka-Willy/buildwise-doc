Understanding how Tooli's AI agents handle conversation history is essential for getting consistent, relevant responses throughout your construction projects. This guide explains context windows and strategies for managing conversations effectively.

<Info>
Tooli's agents don't have memory across separate conversations - they only remember what's in the current conversation's context window.
</Info>

## What is a Context Window?

Think of the context window as the AI agent's "working memory" - it's how much of your conversation the agent can "see" and remember at any given moment during your project discussion.

**Construction Analogy:**
Imagine reviewing project drawings through a small window that only shows you a few sheets at a time. As you slide to see new drawings, the earlier ones slide out of view. That's how a context window works with your conversation history.

### Why It Matters for Construction Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Project Continuity" icon="bullseye">
The agent can only reference project details within its current context window.
</Card>

<Card title="Technical Consistency" icon="link">
Complex project specifications from early in long conversations may be "forgotten."
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### What Happens When Context Fills Up?

When a project conversation exceeds the context window, the agent "forgets" the earliest parts of your discussion. This can lead to:

- Loss of original project specifications or client requirements
- Inconsistency with earlier design decisions or material choices
- Confused responses when you reference earlier project phases

<Warning>
If you reference project details from much earlier in a long conversation and get a confused response, the context window may be full. Start a new conversation and summarize the relevant project context.
</Warning>

## When to Start vs. Continue Conversations

Knowing when to continue a project conversation versus starting a new one is crucial for maintaining quality construction advice.

**When to Start a New Conversation**

Start a new conversation when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="New Project Phase" icon="arrows-turn-to-dots">
Moving from planning to execution, or starting a different trade's work.
</Card>

<Card title="Different Project Entirely" icon="building">
Switching from residential to commercial work, or different clients.
</Card>

<Card title="Agent Getting Confused" icon="circle-question">
The agent references incorrect project details or gives inconsistent advice.
</Card>

<Card title="Long Technical Discussions" icon="scroll">
Extended conversations about complex structural or systems issues.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
If responses about your project decline in quality, starting fresh with a good project summary is more efficient than trying to course-correct.
</Warning>

**When to Continue a Conversation**

Continue the current conversation when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Same Project Phase" icon="layer-group">
Each response directly relates to the current work scope.
</Card>

<Card title="Iterative Design" icon="pen-to-square">
You're refining quotes, plans, or specifications discussed earlier.
</Card>

<Card title="Related Project Elements" icon="sitemap">
Exploring different aspects of the same renovation or construction project.
</Card>

<Card title="Sequential Work Planning" icon="memory">
The agent needs to remember earlier decisions about materials, timeline, or methods.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Ask yourself: "Does the agent need to remember our previous project discussion to give good construction advice?" If yes, continue. If no, start fresh.
</Tip>

## Building on Previous Responses

Effective project conversations build naturally on construction work already discussed.

**Example progression:**
You: "What are the key considerations for a kitchen renovation in a 1960s home?"

Agent: [Provides explanation including plumbing updates, electrical compliance, and structural considerations]

You: "You mentioned electrical compliance as important. What specific upgrades are required to meet current Belgian electrical codes for kitchen appliances?"

You: "Given those electrical requirements, how should we sequence the work to minimize disruption to the family living there?"

In longer project conversations, periodically summarize key decisions to reinforce important context:

So far for this bathroom renovation we've established:
1. Budget is €15,000 maximum
2. Client wants walk-in shower instead of bathtub
3. Plumbing needs updating to current Belgian standards
4. Work must complete in 3 weeks before family holiday

Given these constraints, what's the critical path for scheduling trades?

## Project-Specific Conversation Strategies

### Managing Multi-Trade Projects

For complex renovations involving multiple trades, organize conversations by work package:

Conversation 1: "Kitchen Renovation - Structural & Plumbing"
Conversation 2: "Kitchen Renovation - Electrical & Lighting"  
Conversation 3: "Kitchen Renovation - Finishes & Timeline"

This keeps technical discussions focused and prevents mixing incompatible advice.

### Client Communication vs. Technical Planning

Use separate conversations for different purposes:

Technical Conversation: "Structural analysis for load-bearing wall removal"
Client Conversation: "How to explain structural work to homeowner in simple terms"

### Rehydrating Project Context

When starting a fresh conversation about an ongoing project, provide a concise summary:

"Project context: We're doing a complete bathroom renovation in a 1980s townhouse in Ghent. Client budget is €18,000, timeline is 4 weeks, and we've already confirmed the structural floor can support a new tile installation. The plumbing rough-in is complete and inspected.

New question: What's the optimal sequence for tiling, fixture installation, and final plumbing connections to minimize rework?"

## Agent-Specific Conversation Management

Different Tooli agents work best with different conversation approaches:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="General Assistant">
**Best for:** Extended project discussions and guidance to other agents
**Strategy:** Continue conversations when exploring related aspects of the same project
**When to restart:** When switching to completely different project types
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quote Builder">
**Best for:** Focused quote development sessions
**Strategy:** One conversation per quote or major scope revision
**When to restart:** For each new client project or major scope change
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quality Coach">
**Best for:** Iterative quote improvement
**Strategy:** Continue while refining the same quote
**When to restart:** When reviewing completely different quotes or project types
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="BoQ Checker">
**Best for:** Single document analysis sessions
**Strategy:** Usually one conversation per document review
**When to restart:** For each new bill of quantities or project phase
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Variation Builder">
**Best for:** Individual change request development
**Strategy:** One conversation per change order or variation
**When to restart:** For each distinct project change or different contract
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Report Builder">
**Best for:** Single meeting or documentation session

## Common Construction Conversation Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Mixing Different Projects">
**Problem:** Discussing multiple client projects in one conversation, leading to mixed specifications and recommendations.

**Solution:** Use separate conversations for each client project, even if they're similar work types.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Losing Project Specifications">
**Problem:** Long technical discussions where original client requirements get forgotten in the context window.

**Solution:** Periodically restate key project parameters (budget, timeline, client preferences) in long conversations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expecting Cross-Conversation Memory">
**Problem:** Starting a new conversation with "As we discussed about the Smith kitchen project..." without re-establishing context.

**Solution:** Always provide relevant project context when starting fresh conversations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Overloading Single Conversations">
**Problem:** Using one conversation for planning, quoting, execution, and client communication, leading to confused responses.

**Solution:** Separate conversations by purpose and project phase.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices for Construction Conversations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="One Project Per Conversation" icon="building">
Keep client projects separate to avoid mixing specifications and requirements.
</Card>

<Card title="Summarize Key Decisions" icon="list-check">
Periodically restate important project parameters in long technical discussions.
</Card>

<Card title="Fresh Start for Major Changes" icon="refresh">

</Card>

<Card title="Context Reset When Confused" icon="arrows-rotate">
If responses decline in quality, restart with clear project summary.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Think of each conversation as a focused work session. Just like you wouldn't mix electrical planning with finish selection in a real meeting, keep your AI conversations focused on related topics.
