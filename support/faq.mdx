## Technical Problems

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Tooli doesn’t load or freezes" icon="loader">
Try:
- Refreshing the page  
- Logging out and back in  
- Using private/incognito mode  
- Disabling ad blockers or privacy extensions  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My file won’t upload" icon="upload">
Accepted formats:  
**PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, TXT, PNG, JPG**  
(Max 10 files, max 10MB each)

Common issues:
- File is too large  
- File is password-protected  
- File extension unsupported  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My PDF is scanned and Tooli doesn't read it well" icon="file-text">
Tooli can read scanned documents, but quality matters.  

For better accuracy:
- Use a **clear, well-lit scan**  
- Avoid blurry photos or dark shadows  
- Make sure text is readable and not distorted  

If the document is hard to read for a human, Tooli may struggle too.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tooli misunderstood my document" icon="search">
This can happen when:
- The text is faint, blurry, or handwritten  
- The layout is complex (tables inside tables, rotated pages)  
- Important information is in images instead of text  

Tip:  
Add a short message explaining the key parts you want Tooli to focus on.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Excel & File Processing

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="My Excel file loses formatting inside Tooli" icon="table">
Tooli can work with Excel data in many ways (reading, writing, formulas, formatting).  
However, depending on the tool you are using, some visual formatting (colors, borders, merged cells) may not always appear exactly the same.

For the best results:
- Avoid complex merged cells  
- Keep column headers clear  
- Prefer clean, simple data structures  

(A dedicated page on Excel tools will explain advanced options like applying formulas, reading ranges, formatting cells, creating tables, charts, etc.)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which Excel actions does Tooli support?" icon="list-check">
Tooli supports many operations, such as:
- Applying and validating formulas  
- Reading and writing data  
- Formatting ranges  
- Creating charts and pivot tables  
- Managing worksheets (create, delete, rename)  
- Copying, inserting, deleting ranges  

A full guide is available in the **Excel Agent** section.
</Accordion>

## Mobile & Device Support

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I use Tooli on mobile?" icon="mobile">
Yes — Tooli works very well on mobile and tablet.  
You can chat, upload documents, and use all agents on mobile.

For complex files (BoQs, large PDFs), many users prefer desktop simply because the screen is larger — but Tooli works great on both.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Tooli work on all browsers?" icon="globe">
Yes — Tooli supports all major browsers:

- Chrome  
- Edge  
- Safari  
- Firefox  

If you experience issues, try private/incognito mode or disable extensions temporarily.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## File & Document Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can Tooli read handwritten notes?" icon="pencil">
Yes — as long as the handwriting is clear and readable.  
If the text is messy, faint, or written at an angle, Tooli may misinterpret some words.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I upload photos from my phone?" icon="camera">
Yes.  
Just make sure:
- The photo is stable and well lit  
- Text is not too small  
- The document fills most of the frame  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tooli extracted the wrong values from my table" icon="grid">
Tables can sometimes be tricky if:
- Cells are merged  
- Borders are not aligned  
- The table contains nested elements  

Try uploading a cleaner version or adding a note explaining which section matters.
</Accordion>

## Agent-Related Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why did the Offer Coach flag items as unclear?" icon="info">
Common causes:
- Missing units  
- Labour and materials mixed  
- No validity period  
- No assumptions written  
- Vague or open-ended descriptions  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tender Checker detected duplicates — what does it mean?" icon="copy">
Two lines may describe nearly the same work with the same unit.  
This often requires **clarification from the client** before pricing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Meeting Minutes Writer skipped details" icon="file-text">
The agent structures your notes logically, but cannot invent missing information.  
Add any missing names, dates, decisions, or context for best results.
</Accordion>

Normal — it simply recommends the specialist that fits your task best.
