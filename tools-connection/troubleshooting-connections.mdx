## Quick Fixes to Try First

Before contacting support, try these simple solutions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Disconnect and Reconnect">
This resolves most connection issues:

1. Go to the MCP panel on the right side
2. Click on the problematic business system
3. Select **"Revoke"**
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Click **"Initialize"** again and re-enter your credentials
6. Enable the connection for your AI model

</Step>

<Step title="Refresh Your Page">
Sometimes the connection just needs a refresh:

1. Refresh your browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Wait for WonkaChat to reload
3. Try your query again

This can resolve temporary connection hiccups.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Your Internet Connection">
Ensure you have a stable connection:

- Test your internet speed
- Try loading other websites
- Switch networks if possible (WiFi vs. mobile hotspot)
- Restart your router if needed
<Check>
Those 3 simple steps fixes most connection problems by refreshing the authentication token and clearing any cached credentials that may have become stale or corrupted.

## Common Connection Problems

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication Failed" icon="circle-xmark">
**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" error message
- Can't complete the login process
- Redirected to login page repeatedly

**Solutions:**

**1. Check Your Credentials**
- Make sure you're using the correct username and password
- Try logging into the business system directly (outside WonkaChat) to verify your credentials work
- If you recently changed your password, update it in WonkaChat

**2. Reconnect the Business System**
- Disconnect the business system from the MCP panel
- Wait 10 seconds
- Reconnect with your current credentials

<Tip>
Test your credentials on the business system's website first before trying to connect through WonkaChat.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="ban">
**Symptoms:**
- "Access denied" or "Insufficient permissions" error
- AI says it cannot access certain data
- "403 Forbidden" message

**Why This Happens:**


**1. Your Organization Blocks Third-Party Apps**

Some companies restrict employees from connecting external applications for security reasons.

**Solution:**
- Contact your IT or Security team
- Ask them to approve WonkaChat as a trusted third-party application
- They may need to whitelist WonkaChat in your organization's security settings

**Examples:**
- Google Workspace admin settings
- Microsoft 365 admin center
- Company firewall or VPN restrictions

**2. You Didn't Grant All Permissions**

During the OAuth connection process, you may have denied some permissions that WonkaChat needs.

**Solution:**
- Disconnect the business system
- Reconnect and **grant all requested permissions** when prompted
- Some business systems let you selectively approve permissions. You need to check if WonkaChat need broader access or not.


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection Timeout or Slow Response" icon="clock">
**Symptoms:**
- "Connection timed out" message
- Requests take a very long time
- No response from the business system

**Quick Fixes:**

**1. Refresh Your Page**
- Press F5 or Ctrl+R to reload WonkaChat
- Try your request again

**2. Check Your Internet Connection**
- Test your network speed
- Try switching networks
- Close unnecessary browser tabs

**3. Simplify Your Request**
- If you're asking for a lot of data, try a smaller request first
- Instead of "all emails this year," try "emails from this week"
- Break complex requests into smaller steps

**4. Check the Business System's Status**
- The business system itself might be experiencing issues
- Visit the business system's status page (e.g., status.google.com, status.microsoft.com)
- Wait for the service to come back online

<Info>
If the business system's servers are down, there's nothing WonkaChat can do until the provider fixes it.
</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Not Responding" icon="triangle-exclamation">
**Symptoms:**
- AI says "Unable to connect to [business system]"
- Connection shows as active, but queries fail
- No data returned from the business system

**1. You Don't Have Access in the Business System Itself**

Sometimes you're trying to do something through AI that you can't do directly in the business system either.

<Warning>
**Important:** WonkaChat can only do what YOU can do. If you don't have permission to access a file, read an email, or edit a record in the business system itself, WonkaChat can't do it for you through MCP.
</Warning>

**Example:** If you can't access a specific Google Drive folder because you're not a member, WonkaChat can't access it either.

**Solution:** Get the proper permissions in the business system first, then try again in WonkaChat.


**2. Check the Business System Directly**
- Log into the business system outside of WonkaChat
- Verify it's working normally
- Confirm you can access the data you're requesting

**3. Business System API Limits**
- Some business systems limit how many requests you can make
- If you've made many requests in a short time, wait 15-30 minutes
- Then try again
