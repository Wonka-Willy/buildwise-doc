**Sign in with:**
- **Google Workspace** (your company Google account)

<Info>
SSO uses OpenID Connect for secure, seamless authentication with your existing credentials.
</Info>

<Check>
No new password to remember, you can just use your existing work account credentials.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Invitation Setup">
If you're the first user from your organization:

1. Check your email for a WonkaChat invitation
2. Click the invitation link
3. Create your account credentials
4. Complete your profile setup
5. Begin configuring your organization's WonkaChat instance

</Warning>

### Step-by-Step Connection

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the MCP Settings">
On the right side of your WonkaChat interface, locate and click the **Outlook MCP** button in the tools panel.

</Info>

</Step>


<Step title="Add Your Credentials">
A connection window will appear asking for your credentials. Enter the required information:
- Your Outlook email address
- Authentication credentials (this will use your organization's authentication method)

</Frame>

<Info>
WonkaChat uses secure authentication and never stores your password. All credentials are encrypted.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Connection for Your Model">
After connecting, you need to authorize the External connection (MCP) for the AI model you're using.

<Frame caption="Enable MCP for your model">

</Frame>

Click **"MCP Servers"** and select connection which (MCP) you want the AI model to use.

<Check>
Once the Outlook connection (MCP) is enabled, the AI can read your emails, access your calendar, send messages on your behalf, and handle any Outlook-related tasks through natural conversation.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

</Step>

<Step title="Your First Connected Conversation">

Now that Outlook is connected, let's use it in a conversation:

### Send a message to the connected AI model

Type something like:

```
What's on my outlook calendar today?
```
<Warning>
The AI will only access Outlook data when you explicitly ask it to. It respects your existing permissions and won't perform actions without your knowledge.
</Warning>


WonkaChat will:
- Access your Outlook calendar through the external connection
- Retrieve your schedule
- Present it in an organized format

<Check>
You've successfully connected a tool and used it through natural conversation!
</Check>

</Step>
