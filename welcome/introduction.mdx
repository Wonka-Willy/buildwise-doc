## Core Concept

Wonka Chat consolidates your work across multiple software applications into a single chat interface. Instead of switching between different tools, you interact with one interface that coordinates actions across your connected systems.

Think of it as your intelligent business assistant that:
- Understands your company's processes and data
- Connects to all your existing tools and systems
- Executes multi-step workflows across different platforms
- Keeps your data secure within your environment

<Frame caption="Example: Automated employee onboarding across multiple systems">
<img src="/images/wonkachat-intro.png" alt="Onboarding Agent orchestrating tasks across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other business tools" />
</Frame>

In this example, a request to "Run New Employee Onboarding" automatically:

1. ✅ Gets information from **Notion** (onboarding checklist)
2. ✅ Creates email account in **Microsoft 365**
3. ✅ Sends access codes via **Outlook**
4. ✅ Schedules onboarding meeting in **Outlook Calendar**
5. ✅ Creates **Odoo** account and sends invitation
6. ✅ Sends onboarding presentation via email

<Check>
This is the power of WonkaChat: complex multi-step workflows across different tools, managed through natural conversation.
</Check>

In this example, a simple request triggers actions across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other tools, all coordinated through one platform and one conversation.
