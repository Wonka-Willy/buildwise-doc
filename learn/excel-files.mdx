## Excel, Everywhere in Tooli

You can use Excel features **at any moment**, with **any Tooli agent** — General Agent, Offer Coach, Tender Checker, or Meeting Minutes Writer.

Just ask for what you need.

Tooli can:
- create a new Excel for you  
- work inside the Excel you upload  
- extract data from PDFs or images and place it correctly in your spreadsheet  
- show you parts of your Excel directly inside the chat  

And all of this without using formulas, codes, or cell references.

<Info>
**You speak to Tooli about Excel like you would to a colleague.  
No “A1/B3”. No technical syntax. Just plain construction language.**

## Speak Naturally — Tooli Understands

You don’t need to think like Excel.  
Tooli reads and understands your file the way **a human colleague** would.

Just describe what you want:

- “Add a column for Unit Price.”  
- “Move this list into a new sheet called Materials.”  
- “Show me the quantities table.”  
- “Add a total at the bottom.”  

Tooli finds the right place automatically using your column names (“Item”, “Qty”, “Total TTC”, “Remark”), even in FR/NL/EN.

You focus on the construction content — Tooli handles the spreadsheet work.

## See Your Excel Directly in the Chat

If you need to check something from your spreadsheet, you can ask Tooli to show it inside the chat.

**Examples:**
- “Show the header row.”  
- “Display rows 1 to 20.”  
- “Show the Description and Quantity columns.”  
- “What's inside the Summary sheet?”  

Tooli renders a clean, readable table right below your message.

No more switching windows.  
No more searching through tabs.

## Downloading Your Excel File

At any point, you can retrieve the Excel Tooli is working on.

Ways to download:
- Click the **download button** below the chat bar  
- Or ask: *“Send me the download link for the Excel.”*

You receive a clean `.xlsx` file ready for Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, or sharing with colleagues.

<Tip>
If you started from an uploaded file, Tooli doesn’t recreate everything from scratch —  
**it improves and updates your original Excel** without breaking your structure.
