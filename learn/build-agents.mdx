<Steps>
<Step title="Define the goal and constraints">
Write a one‑sentence outcome, guardrails, and what success looks like.

```text
Goal: Draft a weekly customer support summary from Zendesk tickets.
Guardrails: read‑only, redact PII.
Success: 5‑bullet summary + top 3 issues.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Provide context and memory">
Store domain facts, glossary, and examples. Persist short‑term state between steps.
</Step>

<Step title="Equip tools (MCP)">
Expose the data sources and actions the agent can use (e.g., search, tickets:list, analytics:topIssues). See `/learn/mcp`.
</Step>

<Step title="Implement the reasoning loop">
Plan → call tools → observe → revise plan until done. Keep outputs structured.
</Step>

<Step title="Deliver results">
Return a clear artifact (report, JSON, message) and log decisions for auditability.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
When your agent reliably achieves the goal with safe defaults and clear logs, you’re ready to automate.
