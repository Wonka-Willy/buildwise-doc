# Privacy Policy
**Tooli**  
*(Last updated: November 1, 2025)*

## 1. About This Policy

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how we (as defined below) collect, share, and use any information that, used alone or in combination with other information, relates to you ("Personal Data") when you ("you" and "your", "User") create an account to access the intelligent legal assistant ("Tooli") made available to you on the website https://tooli.be/. 

The Policy also applies to account access management, collection of aggregated data for statistical or tracking purposes, and communication of information relating to Tooli's activities and operation.

For Personal Data we collect outside of Tooli, please refer to our Personal Data Protection Policy available at: https://www.Buildwise.be/fr/expertise-soutien/dispositions-legales/#confidencialite.

Please take the time to carefully read this Policy. If you have questions or comments, please contact our data protection officer at: **gdpr@Buildwise.be**.

## Data Controller and Processor Roles

For the purposes of this Policy, **Buildwise**, headquartered at Kleine Kloosterstraat 23, 1932 Zaventem, registered with the Belgian Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under number 0407.695.057, ("Buildwise", "we", "our") acts as data controller for Personal Data collected to offer its service, Tooli.

However, the User acts as data controller under applicable data protection legislation regarding the use of Tooli and all data they integrate into it. In this context, Buildwise acts as data processor.

This Policy sets out Buildwise's commitments regarding data protection and the measures implemented to guarantee the security and confidentiality of your personal data. It also specifies the rights you have in this regard and the practical procedures for exercising them with us.

## 5. Security

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data.

### Security Measures Include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
    **In Transit & At Rest**
    
    All communications protected by HTTPS/TLS (TLS 1.3, with TLS 1.2 support if necessary). Data encrypted at rest.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Environment Isolation" icon="server">
    **Strict Tenant Isolation**
    
    Each organization's data (conversations, configurations, user accounts, audit logs, MCP connections) is logically separated and protected against inter-tenant access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Credential Management" icon="key">
    **Protected Authentication**
    
    Passwords are hashed (bcrypt), access tokens (JWT) are cryptographically signed, and sensitive keys/APIs are never stored in plain text.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Enhanced Authentication" icon="user-shield">
    **Limited Session Duration**
    
    Short-duration access tokens and rotating refresh tokens limit risks. We support local authentication, Buildwise SSO, Google Authentication, and Azure AD/Entra ID.

### Additional Security Features

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access Controls">
    **Principle of Least Privilege**

  <Tab title="Audit & Monitoring">
    **Structured Logging**
    
    We record security-relevant events: authentication attempts, permission changes, suspicious activity, data access, agent/tool executions, and migrations. All sensitive data is automatically masked.

  <Tab title="Abuse Prevention">
    **Operational Protection**
    
    Rate limiting mechanisms protect against abusive automated usage or attacks.

<Note>
**Ephemeral Data Processing by Model Providers:** When an external model (Azure, AWS Bedrock, Google) is used, data is processed only in memory and is never retained or reused for training.
</Note>

## 6. International Data Transfers

Your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than where you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from your own country's laws and, in some cases, may be less protective.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

</CardGroup>

### Transfer Safeguards

We use one or more of the following mechanisms:

- Standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, with additional measures if necessary
- Any other appropriate safeguards provided by GDPR

<Warning>
We do not transfer any data outside the EEA without implementing these safeguards and ensuring data subjects have enforceable rights and effective remedies.
</Warning>

## 7. Data Retention
