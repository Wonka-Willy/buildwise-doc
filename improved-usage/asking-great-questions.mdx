## Basic Prompting Principles

The foundation of effective AI interaction:

- **Be clear and specific** – Vague questions produce vague answers
- **Use positive instructions** – Focus on what you want, not what you don't want  
- **Provide context** – Give relevant background information to tailor responses

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Be clear and specific" icon="bullseye">
The more specific your request, the better the response.

**Instead of:**
Tell me about foundations.

**Try:**
Explain the three most suitable foundation types for a 2-story residential building on clay soil in Belgium, including cost considerations and building code requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use positive instructions" icon="check">
Focus on what you want the AI to do, rather than what you don't want.

**Instead of:**
Don't make it too technical.

**Try:**
Explain this in simple terms that a property owner would understand during a client presentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide context" icon="circle-info">
Give the AI relevant background information to tailor its response.

**Example:**
I'm a contractor working on a bathroom renovation in a 1960s apartment building in Brussels. The client wants modern fixtures but we've discovered old plumbing that may need updating. What are the key considerations for upgrading plumbing while minimizing disruption to neighboring units?

<Tip>
Think of Tooli's agents as experienced colleagues who need context to give you the best construction advice.

## Context Setting Techniques

Proper context ensures the AI understands your project goals, constraints, and requirements.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Define Your Project" icon="users">
Specify the type of construction work and stakeholders involved.
</Card>

<Card title="Set the Scope" icon="bullseye">
Clearly define project boundaries, budget, and timeline constraints.
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Examples" icon="lightbulb">
Show examples of similar projects or desired outcomes.
</Card>

<Card title="State Your Goal" icon="flag-checkered">
Explain what you need to deliver to clients or use on-site.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Effective Context-Setting Pattern for Construction

Use this structure to provide comprehensive project context:

[Role/Expertise]: I'm a [contractor/project manager/architect] working on [project type]

[Project Details]: Currently working on [describe project and location]

GOAL: What I need to achieve

CONSTRAINTS: 
- Budget: [amount or range]
- Timeline: [project duration]
- Regulations: [specific Belgian/local requirements]
- Site limitations: [access, space, etc.]

STAKEHOLDERS: Client type and presentation requirements

REFERENCE: Similar projects or current approach (if applicable)

[Your specific question]

**Example:**
Role: I'm a general contractor specializing in residential renovations

Project Details: Complete kitchen renovation in a 1980s townhouse in Ghent, 12m² space with load-bearing wall considerations.

GOAL: Create a detailed quote and project timeline for client presentation next week

CONSTRAINTS:
- Budget: €25,000-30,000 (client's maximum)
- Timeline: Must complete before Christmas (8 weeks)
- Regulations: Need electrical compliance with latest Belgian standards
- Site limitations: Narrow access, must maintain living space during work

STAKEHOLDERS: Young family with two children, need clear explanation of disruption periods and safety measures

REFERENCE: Recently completed similar project in Antwerp that went smoothly, client loved the phased approach to minimize disruption

Question: What's the best sequence for this renovation to minimize family disruption, and what are the key milestones I should highlight in the client presentation?

<Check>
This structure applies all four context-setting techniques specifically for construction projects: stating your project goal, defining stakeholders, setting constraints, and providing relevant project examples.

## Structured Output Requests

Requesting specific formats helps you get responses that are immediately usable on construction projects.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Project Lists and Schedules" icon="list">
Request organized information in scannable format for project management.

**Example:**
List the 5 most critical phases for a bathroom renovation project. For each phase:
- Name of the phase
- Duration estimate
- Key trades involved
- Dependencies on previous phases
- Potential delays to watch for
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Material Comparisons" icon="table">
Get side-by-side comparisons for material selection and client presentations.

**Example:**
Create a comparison table for kitchen countertop materials with these columns:
- Material name
- Cost per m² (including installation)
- Durability (years)
- Maintenance requirements
- Best suited for (cooking style/family type)
- Belgian supplier availability
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step-by-Step Procedures" icon="list-ol">
Request procedures for construction processes and safety protocols.

**Example:**
Provide step-by-step instructions for installing underfloor heating in a bathroom renovation. Include:
1. Preparation requirements
2. Each installation step with safety considerations
3. Testing procedures at each stage
4. Belgian electrical compliance checkpoints
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quote Formats" icon="calculator">
Request professional quote structures ready for client presentation.

**Example:**
Format this renovation scope into a professional quote structure:
- Executive summary for client
- Detailed scope breakdown by trade
- Timeline with key milestones
- Payment schedule
- Exclusions and assumptions
- Belgian warranty standards
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Output Length and Detail Level" icon="book">
Specify desired length for different audiences (clients vs. internal use).

**Examples:**
Summarize this in exactly 3 bullet points for client email.
Provide a comprehensive technical analysis for building permit application.
Give me a brief safety overview first, then detailed implementation steps.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## MASTER Prompt Technique

For complex construction communications, use the MASTER framework to structure comprehensive prompts:

**M** - Mission (what you need to accomplish)  
**A** - Anchor (key project details and constraints)  
**S** - Samples (examples of successful similar work)  
**T** - Tone (professional level and audience)  
**E** - Elements (specific components to include)  
**R** - Role (your expertise and perspective)

### Construction Example:

Write a project delay notification email to the client for our kitchen renovation.

MISSION: Inform client about 1-week delay while maintaining trust and professionalism

ANCHOR: Our company, Bouwwerken VDB, is renovating their kitchen in a 1960s home in Leuven. Discovered asbestos tiles during demolition that require certified removal. Project was scheduled to complete next Friday, now delayed until the following week.

SAMPLES: I've attached previous client communications that were well-received - they focus on solutions rather than problems and include clear next steps.

ROLE: You are an experienced general contractor with 15 years in residential renovation.

ELEMENTS:
- Explanation of delay (asbestos discovery and safety requirements)
- Revised timeline with new completion date
- How we're handling the additional cost (absorbed by us due to inadequate initial inspection)
- Safety measures being taken
- Daily progress updates during remediation

TONE: Professional but reassuring, focusing on safety and solution-oriented approach while acknowledging the inconvenience.

## Prompt Engineering for Construction

Advanced strategies for construction-specific prompting:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Iterative Project Development" icon="arrows-rotate">
Build project solutions through multiple prompt refinements.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with project basics">
Begin with essential project information.

I need help planning a loft conversion in a 1930s house in Brussels.
</Step>

<Step title="Evaluate and add specificity">
Assess the response and add construction-specific details.

I need help planning a loft conversion in a 1930s house in Brussels. The space is 40m², client wants 2 bedrooms, and we need to consider structural beams and stair access. Budget is €35,000.
</Step>

<Step title="Focus on specific challenges">
Drill down into technical or regulatory aspects.

Given the structural beams in this loft conversion, what are the Belgian building code requirements for ceiling height and emergency egress for the two bedrooms?
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Building on Construction Knowledge" icon="comments">
Use Tooli's responses to explore related construction challenges.

**Pattern:**
First prompt: "Explain the structural considerations for removing a wall in a 1960s home."

Follow-up: "You mentioned load-bearing assessment. What specific tests should we conduct before any demolition, and what Belgian professionals need to be involved?"

Further follow-up: "If the wall is load-bearing, what are the most cost-effective beam solutions for a 4-meter span in residential construction?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Role-Based Construction Expertise" icon="user-tie">
Assign specific construction expertise to get targeted advice.

**Example:**
You are an experienced Belgian structural engineer. Review this proposed beam installation for a wall removal project and identify potential issues with building codes, safety factors, and installation challenges.

## Common Construction Prompting Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Being Too Generic About Projects">
**Problem:** "Tell me about bathroom renovations."

**Better:** "Plan a bathroom renovation for a 1970s apartment in Antwerp: 2.5x1.8m space, budget €12,000, client wants walk-in shower and modern fixtures. What's the optimal layout and sequence?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Critical Project Details">
**Problem:** "Create a quote for kitchen renovation" [without size, budget, location, or client preferences]

**Better:** Include space dimensions, budget range, desired finishes, timeline, and any structural considerations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ignoring Belgian Regulations">
**Problem:** "What's the standard electrical setup for kitchens?" [without specifying Belgian codes]

**Better:** "What electrical requirements must we meet for a kitchen renovation in Belgium, including circuit protection and appliance connections per current NBN standards?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Not Specifying Audience Level">
**Problem:** "Explain foundation requirements" [unclear if for client presentation or technical implementation]

**Better:** "Explain foundation requirements for client presentation - homeowner needs to understand why we recommend concrete over existing stone foundation for their extension."
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
